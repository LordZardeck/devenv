# Development Environment
This setup relies on Vagrant and VirtualBox (or [VMWare Fusion](#vmware-provider) if that's what you prefer) running on Mac OS X to power the virtualized developer environment. These dependencies are installed as part of the setup process using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io).

It is setup with two primary machines: web and db. Together these two virtual machines provide all the neccesary components to build on Magento 1 and Magento 2, including support for running multiple PHP / MySql versions side-by-side if neccesary ([see below for details](#virtual-machines)). The web node runs a traditional LAMP stack, with Nginx sitting in front of Apache as a proxy for static assets. It also includes [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org) pre-configured to connect to your IDE on the host machine.

## System Requirements
* Mac OS X 10.9 or later
* An HFS+ **Case-sensitive** partition mounted at `/Volumes/Server` or `/server`

    *Note: The environment should install and run from a case-insensitive mount, but this is not reccomended for two reasons: a) the majority of deployments are done to case-sensitive file-systems, so development done on a case-sensitive mount is less error prone (ex: autoloaders may find a class in development, then fail on production); b) mysql will behave differently as it pertains to [identifier case sensitivity](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html) potentially causing unexpected behavior*

## Environment Setup

1. Install technical dependencies and setup the environment, entering your account password when prompted (this may happen a few times):

        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidalger/devenv/master/vagrant/bin/install.sh | bash
        source /etc/profile

2. Run the following to start up the virtual machines. This may take a while on first run

        cd /server
        vagrant up

3. To SSH into the vm, you can use `vcd` or `vcd web` to connect and automatically mirror your working directory

### Optional Steps

1. Install the compass tools used for scss compilation

        sudo gem update --system
        sudo gem install compass

2. Generate an RSA key pair. The generated public key will be used to authenticate remote SSH connections

        ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    *Note: When prompted, enter a memorable passphrase (youâ€™ll need to use it later)*

3. Because of GitHub's rate limits on their API it can happen that Composer will silently fail on the m2.dev provisioning step of the dev-web machine. To prevent this from happening, create an OAuth token via the [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) area in your GitHub account. You can read more about these tokens [here](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens). Add this token to the composer configuration by running:

        composer config -g github-oauth.github.com <oauthtoken>

4. Create the m2.dev site:

        vagrant ssh web -- /server/vagrant/bin/m2site.sh
        echo "10.19.89.10 m2.dev" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null

## Virtual Machines

### dev-web
This node is setup to run services required to run web applications. Nginx is setup to deliver static assets directly and act as a proxy for anything else. Apache is setup with mod_php to delivery the web application and sits behind Nginx on an internal port. Redis has been setup for a cache data store such that it never writes information to disk.

Run `vhosts.sh` to generate vhosts for all sites and reload apache. This will be automatically run once when the machine is provisioned, and may be subsequently run from `/server/vagrant/bin/vhosts.sh` on either the host or guest environment.

The IP address of this node is fixed at `10.19.89.10`. This IP should be used in `/etc/hosts` on the host machine to facilitate loading applications running within the vm from a browser on the host.

#### PHP Versions

This node has PHP 5.6 from Remi's repository installed. Older versions are available as pre-configured machines, but do not start automatically. To use them, start via `vagrant up web55` or similar. Then configure your local hosts file to point the site needing this specific version of PHP to the correct machine instance.

#### m2.dev
By default one site is automatically created upon machine initialization. It is m2.dev and will run off of the official magento/magento2 repositories develop branch.

To access this site, you'll need to add an entry to your local /etc/hosts file (as with any other site running the vm) and use the following information to login to the admin:

* [http://m2.dev/backend/admin/](http://m2.dev/backend/admin/)
* user: admin
* pass: A123456

### dev-db
This node has MySql 5.6.x installed. Since this is a development environment, the root mysql password has been left blank.

To allow for custom database settings without modifying the default my.cnf file directly, files found at `vagrant/etc/my.cnf.d/*.cnf` will be copied onto this node and are applied via the `!includedir` directive in the `/etc/my.cnf` defaults file. Example use case: create the file `vagrant/etc/my.cnf.d/lower_case_table_names.cnf` with the following contents and then re-provision the vm:

    [mysqld]
    lower_case_table_names = 1

***WARNING:*** Because this node is running the mysqld service and persisting data, attempts to forcefully shutdown (aka run `vagrant destroy`) on the db node will cause data corruption and fail subsequent mysqld start operations unless the vm has first been halted and/or the mysqld service stopped gracefully prior to vm destruction. The recommended sequence to wipe the vm and create from scratch is halt, destroy, then up.

#### MySql Versions

This node has MySql 5.6 from the community MySql RPM installed. Should MySql 5.1 be required, there is a pre-configured machine available, but it will not start by default. Start this machine via `vagrant up db51`. The data directory of this will be kept separate from the MySql 5.6 data in order to preserve data integrity. These machines may be run simultaneously. Configure sites to connect to `dev-db` or `dev-db51` as needed.

## dev-solr
This node does not boot by default and currently does nothing. It is here as a placeholder for running Solr once the provisioning scripts for it are created.

## Development Notes

### Session Storage
It is well recognized that PHP cannot store sessions on an NFS mount. Since /var/www/sites/ is mounted in the vm via an NFS mount, this causes trouble with applications which attempt using a session directory inside the document root. Magento 2 seems to handle this just fine and stores it's sessions in the configured session location. Magento 1 requires one of three workarounds to function:

1. add the following to the `app/etc/local.xml` configuration file inside the `global` node:

        <session_save><![CDATA[files]]></session_save>
        <session_save_path><![CDATA[/var/lib/php/session]]]]></session_save_path>

2. create a soft-link pointing the `var/session` directory to the default php session location

        ln -s /var/lib/php/session var/session

3. use an alternative session storage mechanism such as redis or memcached

## VMWare Provider

Using VMWare Fusion is a supported (but non-default) setup. There are additional steps involved to use it due to differences in how Virtual Box and VMX configure network interfaces and handle NFS mounts.

For NFS mounts to function, run the following to add the necessary exports to your `/etc/exports` file on the host machine and restart nfsd:

        MAPALL="-mapall=$(id -u):$(grep ^admin: /etc/group | cut -d : -f 3)"
        MOUNT_DIR="$(readlink /server || echo /server)"
        printf "%s\n%s\n" \
            "$MOUNT_DIR/sites/ -alldirs -network 192.168.235.0 -mask 255.255.255.0 $MAPALL" \
            "$MOUNT_DIR/mysql/ -alldirs -network 192.168.235.0 -mask 255.255.255.0 $MAPALL" \
            | sudo tee -a /etc/exports > /dev/null
        sudo nfsd restart
