# Development Environment

## Environment Setup
There should be a 150 GB *Mac OS X Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)* partition named Server present on the host machine before beginning this setup procedure. If this does not exist, please create one. This can be done via Disk Utility while booted into Recovery Mode. Running `ls -lhd /Volumes/Server` will easily determine if this partition is present or not.

1. Retrieve your personal access token from the [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page and set this in your current shell by running the following (replacing <your_token> with the one you previously retrieved from your GitHub account):

        export HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=<your_token_here>

2. Run the following to kickstart your environment (you will be prompted for your password multiple times while the first line runs):

        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidalger/devenv/master/bin/glowbot.py | python
        cd /server
        sudo chown $(whoami):admin /server
        git init
        git remote add origin https://github.com/davidalger/devenv.git
        git fetch origin
        git checkout master
        vagrant status
        source /etc/profile

3. Run the following to export paths mounted within the virtual machines

        MAPALL="-mapall=$(id -u):$(grep ^admin: /etc/group | cut -d : -f 3)"
        printf "%s\n%s\n" \
            "/Volumes/Server/sites/ -alldirs -network 192.168.235.0 -mask 255.255.255.0 $MAPALL" \
            "/Volumes/Server/sites/ -alldirs -network 10.19.89.0 -mask 255.255.255.0 $MAPALL" \
            "/Volumes/Server/mysql/ -alldirs -network 192.168.235.0 -mask 255.255.255.0 $MAPALL" \
            "/Volumes/Server/mysql/ -alldirs -network 10.19.89.0 -mask 255.255.255.0 $MAPALL" \
            | sudo tee -a /etc/exports > /dev/null
        sudo nfsd restart

4. Add the following to the `/etc/hosts` file on the host machine using `mate /etc/hosts` or `vi /etc/hosts`:

        ##################################################
        ## Developer Environment
        
        10.19.89.1  dev-host
        10.19.89.10 dev-web
        10.19.89.20 dev-db
        10.19.89.30 dev-solr
        
        ##################################################
        ## Vagrant Sites
        
        10.19.89.10 m2.dev
        

5.  Add the following to the `~/.my.cnf` file on the host machine:

        [client]
        host=dev-db
        user=root
        password=
        
    
    _Note: If there is a `~/.mylogin.cnf` file present on the host, it will supersede this file, potentially breaking things._

6. Install the compass tools used for scss compilation

        sudo gem update --system
        sudo gem install compass

7. Generate an RSA key pair. The generated public key will be used to authenticate remote SSH connections

        ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    *Note: When prompted, enter a memorable passphrase (youâ€™ll need to use it later)*

8. Run the following to start up the virtual machines. This will take a while on first run

        cd /server
        vagrant up

9. You should be ready to roll! Go ahead and load the [m2.dev](http://m2.dev/) site which should be setup and running inside the virtual machine to make sure everything is working correctly

10. To SSH into the vm, you can use `vcd` or `vcd web` to connect and automatically mirror the working directory if a matching location exists on the vm

## Virtual Machines

### dev-web
This node is setup to run services required to run web applications. Nginx is setup to deliver static assets directly and act as a proxy for anything else. Apache is setup with mod_php to delivery the web application and sits behind Nginx on an internal port. Redis has been setup for a cache data store such that it never writes information to disk.

Run `vhosts.sh` to generate vhosts for all sites and reload apache. This will be automatically run once when the machine is provisioned, and may be subsequently run from `/server/vagrant/bin/vhosts.sh` on either the host or guest environment.

The IP address of this node is fixed at `10.19.89.10`. This IP should be used in `/etc/hosts` on the host machine to facilitate loading applications running within the vm from a browser on the host.

By default this node is configured to install PHP 5.6 from Remi's repository. Different versions of PHP may be chosen by exporting the `VAGRANT_PHP_VERSION` variable on the command line prior to running `vagrant up` for the first time. To switch PHP versions, export the requested PHP version and then run the following to blow away and re-setup your vm:

        vagrant destroy -f web && vagrant up

The requested version of PHP may be specified  via the following environment variable. Valid values are currently 53, 54, 55 and 56 (default). However, PHP 5.3 is not fully supported as there are no packages available for Xdebug or the ionCube loader in the default RPMs used to build PHP 5.3.

        export VAGRANT_PHP_VERSION=56

#### m2.dev
By default one site is automatically created upon machine initialization. It is m2.dev and will run off of the official magento/magento2 repositories develop branch.

To access this site, you'll need to add an entry to your local /etc/hosts file (as with any other site running the vm) and use the following information to login to the admin:

* [http://m2.dev/backend/admin/](http://m2.dev/backend/admin/)
* user: admin
* pass: A123456

### dev-db
This node has MySql 5.6.x installed. Since this is a development environment, the root mysql password has been left blank.

To allow for custom database settings without modifying the default my.cnf file directly, files found at `vagrant/etc/my.cnf.d/*.cnf` will be copied onto this node and are applied via the `!includedir` directive in the `/etc/my.cnf` defaults file. Example use case: create the file `vagrant/etc/my.cnf.d/lower_case_table_names.cnf` with the following contents and then re-provision the vm:

    [mysqld]
    lower_case_table_names = 1

***WARNING:*** Because this node is running the mysqld service and persisting data, attempts to forcefully shutdown (aka run `vagrant destroy`) on the db node will cause data corruption and fail subsequent mysqld start operations unless the vm has first been halted and/or the mysqld service stopped gracefully prior to vm destruction. The recommended sequence to wipe the vm and create from scratch is halt, destroy, then up.

## dev-solr
This node does not boot by default and currently does nothing. It is here as a placeholder for running Solr once the provisioning scripts for it are created.

## Development Notes

### Session Storage
It is well recognized that PHP cannot store sessions on an NFS mount. Since /var/www/sites/ is mounted in the vm via an NFS mount, this causes trouble with applications which attempt using a session directory inside the document root. Magento 2 seems to handle this just fine and stores it's sessions in the configured session location. Magento 1 requires one of three workarounds to function:

1. add the following to the `app/etc/local.xml` configuration file inside the `global` node:

        <session_save><![CDATA[files]]></session_save>
        <session_save_path><![CDATA[/var/lib/php/session]]]]></session_save_path>

2. create a soft-link pointing the `var/session` directory to the default php session location

        ln -s /var/lib/php/session var/session

3. use an alternative session storage mechanism such as redis or memcached
